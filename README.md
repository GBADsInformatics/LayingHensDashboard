# GBADS Laying Hens Dashboard

This dashboard was created ontop of the [GBADS Dashboard Template](https://github.com/GBADsInformatics/Dashboard_Template) by [@Amardeep](https://github.com/amardeep-1) and [@Nitin](https://github.com/Nitin501)

## Development
Here are the most notable files for editing the dashboard:
- [dashboard.py](https://github.com/GBADsInformatics/LayingHens_Dashboard/blob/main/dash/flask_app/plotlydash/dashboard.py)
  This file includes all the callbacks for the components in the layouts.
- [layouts.py](https://github.com/GBADsInformatics/LayingHens_Dashboard/blob/main/dash/layouts.py)
  The page layouts are made in this file. This is where all the dash components are found. 
- [stylecheet.css](https://github.com/GBADsInformatics/LayingHens_Dashboard/blob/main/dash/flask_app/plotlydash/assets/stylesheet.css)
  Most components are already styled, but add extra styling here
